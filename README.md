This program consists of the Micro-Star Server/Client application project. It consists of a database server and a user client application. 
It uses the phpMyAdmin server to create and store all its data. The server starts automatically when the application is launched. 

There are two different accounts types facilitated by this software: Customer and Employee. 

When you login with a customer account you will enter
the Customer mode of the application. Here you may view the details of your current bill,
view the details of any complaints you may have made and talk in real time with one of
Micro Star’s technician via the Live Chat feature. The Employee mode allows you to view
the complaint details of all customer complaints. You are also allowed to assign technicians
to deal with specific customer complaints. 

For the Live Chat feature to work, the “Server” Java class must be executed.
